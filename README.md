# Tribute_Page
A project for the Free Code Camp Responsive Web Design course; the goal of this project was to create a tribute page to an individual of my choice. 
The page itself contains the following features:
  An image that re-sizes with the browser window.
  Basic html elements, such as "id=main" and id="title".
